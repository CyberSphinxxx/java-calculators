# Java Calculator Collection

This repository contains simple calculator programs written in Java. The calculators can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The current implementations use `else if` statements and `switch` cases to handle different arithmetic modes. More features and modes may be added in the future.

## Features

- **Addition**: Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second number from the first number.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division**: Divides the first number by the second number. Includes a check to prevent division by zero.

## Programs

1. **Switch Calculator** (`switch_calculator.java`): Uses a `switch` statement to handle the selection of arithmetic operations.

2. **Else If Calculator** (`Calculator_ElseIf.java`): Uses `else if` statements to handle the selection of arithmetic operations.
