# Java Calculator Collection

This repository contains simple calculator programs written in Java. The calculators can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The current implementations use `else if` statements and `switch` cases to handle different arithmetic modes. More features and modes may be added in the future.

## Features

- **Addition**: Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second number from the first number.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division**: Divides the first number by the second number. Includes a check to prevent division by zero.

## Programs

1. **Switch Calculator** (`switch_calculator.java`): Uses a `switch` statement to handle the selection of arithmetic operations.

2. **Else If Calculator** (`Calculator_ElseIf.java`): Uses `else if` statements to handle the selection of arithmetic operations.

3. **Ternary Calculator** (`TernaryCalculator.java`): Uses a nested `ternary operator` to perform arithmetic operations in a compact, single-line expression.

5. **Function Calculator**  (`Function_Calculator.java`): Uses functions to handle the selection of arithmetic operations.

## How to Run

### 1. Clone the repository:

```java
git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-calculator-collection.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the directory:
```java
cd java-calculator-collection
```

### 3. Compile the Java files:
```java
javac switch_calculator.java
javac Calculator_ElseIf.java
javac Calculator_Mini.java
javac Function_Calculator.java
```

### 4. Run the program:
   #### For the Switch Calculator:
   ```java
   java switch_calculator
   ```
   ### For the Else If Calculator:
   ```java
   java Calculator_ElseIf
   ```
   ### For the Ternary Calculator
   ```java
   java Calculator_Mini
   ```
